# Description:
The Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of well-documented implementations of various machine learning algorithms written entirely from scratch in Python. Users can better understand their internal workings and principles by delving into machine learning fundamentals and manually coding these algorithms. This repository serves as an educational resource for those interested in machine learning.

Key Features:

    Algorithm Implementations: The repository includes implementations of a wide range of machine learning algorithms, covering both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. This contains but is not limited to:
        Linear Regression
        Logistic Regression
        Decision Trees
        Random Forest
        k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
        Support Vector Machines (SVM)
        K-Means Clustering
        Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
        Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)

    Modular Structure: Each algorithm implementation is structured into modular components, making it easy to understand and modify. The code is well-commented and follows best practices for readability and maintainability.

    Documentation: The repository contains comprehensive documentation for each algorithm, including explanations of the underlying concepts, mathematical formulations, and implementation details.
    
    Example Usage: For each algorithm, example scripts are provided to demonstrate how to use the implementations on sample datasets. These examples cover tasks such as regression, classification, and clustering, allowing users to see the algorithms in action and experiment with different parameters.

    Performance Evaluation: The repository includes utilities for evaluating the performance of the implemented algorithms on various datasets. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed to assess the effectiveness of the algorithms in different scenarios.

    Integration with Popular Libraries: While this repository focuses on implementing algorithms from scratch, users can also find comparisons with implementations from popular machine learning libraries such as Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow. This allows us to benchmark the performance of their implementations against established solutions.

    Contributing Guidelines: The repository welcomes contributions from the community to improve existing implementations, add new algorithms, or fix bugs. Guidelines for contributing are provided to ensure consistency and quality across contributions.
